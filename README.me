    Here are a few suggestions for things you could consider adding to your game:

A user interface (UI) for displaying the player's score, lives, and other information.
A way for the player to place towers on the map, and for those towers to attack and damage the UFOs.
A way for UFOs to attack and damage the player's towers or base.
A way for the player to upgrade their towers.
A way for the player to earn money or points for destroying UFOs, which they can use to buy upgrades or new towers.
A way for the game to end (e.g. when the player loses all their lives or when all UFOs have been destroyed).
A way to increase the difficulty of the game as the player progresses (e.g. by spawning UFOs more quickly or giving them more health).
